# Efficient-Hashing
This is an inquiry resource pertaining to creating efficient hash functions. This repository will provide resources as well as insight into the essentials of hashing, and how to lower the chance of hashing to the same key.

#Problem
We want to learn not only a few different ways to create a hash function, but we also are looking to find ways to minimize the chance of collisions. A collision in the sense of hashing, is the incident in which your hash function maps items in the set to the same key. In the event of a collision the hash function will have to rehash, which will slow down the process of the program being executed.

#Questions
1) Is it possible to create a one-to-one hash function?
2) What conventions are known and identified when attempting to create a hash function?
3) How can the efficiency of a hash function be improved?
4) Does the design of a hash function vary when dealing with small data sets as opposed to large data sets?
5) Does the EchoNest provide any information to developers that assist in contructing hash functions?
